# Azure Developer CLI (azd) Terraform Starter


The project uses Microsoft Learn module on creating an infrastructure as a code template, replaces Bicep files provided with Terraform files and .NET app source with Node.js. 

During the process, I corrected code snippers provided by Microsoft Learn, as some arguments names became outdated and tags' definition had incorrect syntax. 

Please see the notebooks for step by step explanation, commands and images documenting the whole process.
